class MISPIntegration:
    """Integration with MISP for importing IOCs.

    This class provides an interface to integrate with a MISP (Malware Information
    Sharing Platform & Threat Sharing) instance to import Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
    such as IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, and other threat intelligence data.
    In a production environment, this method would handle authentication, data retrieval,
    parsing, and updating the local threat intelligence repository.

        This method simulates the importation of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from a MISP

        retrieve the latest threat intelligence data, process and validate the received IOCs,
